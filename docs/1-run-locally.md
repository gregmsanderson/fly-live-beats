# Run it locally

Start by cloning the repo into a local folder.

## Prerequisites

Phoenix is written in Elixir and so if you would like to run it directly on your local machine you will need to have [Elixir installed](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html). You will also need the Hex package manager to install its dependencies. To add/update that, run `mix local.hex`.

Confirm that worked by running `elixir -v`:

```sh
$ elixir -v
Erlang/OTP 25 [erts-13.1.4] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [ds:4:4:10] [async-threads:1] [jit:ns] [dtrace]

Elixir 1.14.3 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 25)
```

By default Phoenix uses PostgreSQL. If you don't already have it, [install Postgres](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides).

To sign in to the Live Beats app you will need a GitHub OAuth app. You can create one from [https://github.com/settings/applications/new](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). Give it a name, set its homepage to `http://localhost:4000` and its authorization callback URL to `http://localhost:4000/oauth/callbacks/github`. Click the button. You will be shown its client ID. Click the button below that to generate a new client secret. Export them both so that they are ready for the app to use in a moment:

```sh
export LIVE_BEATS_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="swap-this-for-yours"
export LIVE_BEATS_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="swap-this-for-yours"
```

## Prepare it

Install its dependencies by running `mix deps.get`.

If necessary, edit the database values in `config/dev.exs`. However the defaults should work.

Create/migrate your database by running `mix ecto.setup`.

## Run it

Start the server: `mix phx.server` (it may take a couple of minutes to compile).

Once ready, open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser. You should see the sign in screen. Click the button to sign in. You should be authenticated using your GitHub OAuth client ID/secret and redirected back to `http://localhost:4000`.

Once done, stop the server (usually `Ctrl+\`).

Now I'll try containerizing the app to ensure that runs before uploading anything to an external service.

## Run it locally (containerized)

For _this_ part you will need to have Docker. If not you can install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or an equivalent such as [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/). That will install the `docker` command (or the equivalent, `nerdctl`) and run the Docker daemon.

**Note:** The modified version of Live Beats (the one in _this_ repo) should work when run locally. If you try to run the original Live Beats app, it probably wouldn't work. It would expect variables like a `FLY_APP_NAME` that are not present.

Build an image from the `Dockerfile`. That may take a few minutes. I'll call mine `fly-live-beats`:

```sh
$ docker build -t fly-live-beats .
[+] Building
=> [internal] load metadata for docker.io/hexpm/elixir:1.12.0-erlang-24.0.1-debian-bullseye-20210902-slim
...
```

Confirm that worked:

```sh
$ docker images
REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
fly-live-beats   latest    12345          30 seconds ago   119MB
```

Great! It did.

The app will need some more environment variables:

- A `PHX_HOST`. If you don't set this, the WebSocket will throw an error when loaded in the browser. The app needs to know its hostname. Locally that will be `localhost`.

- A `SECRET_KEY_BASE`. To get this value, Phoenix recommends running `mix phx.gen.secret`.

- A `DATABASE_URL`. Since I already have Postgres installed locally I can use the same database that's already been migrated. In theory I could use `DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database`. However using `localhost` won't work. Postgres is not running inside the container. That needs `localhost` to resolve to the host machine. This is a common problem when running a container locally. There are a range of different approaches outlined in this extensive answer: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/24326540](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24326540). In _my_ case I'm running on a Mac using Docker Desktop. That comes with a handy `host.docker.internal` hostname. That is _its_ solution to this problem. It lets you access the host machine from _within_ a running container.

- A `LIVE_BEATS_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `LIVE_BEATS_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`. Handily you can re-use these from earlier, since this container will _also_ run at `http://localhost:4000`.

Now I'll try running a container.

The `-p` specifies the ports to expose (`4000`).

The `-it` flag runs it in interactive mode. That means the output is shown within the terminal. You could _instead_ use `-d` which would avoid that and run the container in the background.

The `--rm` flag means the container will be removed when itâ€™s stopped, which is fine as that saves me from having to.

```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 -e LIVE_BEATS_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="swap-this-for-yours" -e LIVE_BEATS_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="swap-this-for-yours" -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5432/live_beats_dev" -e SECRET_KEY_BASE="its-value" -e PHX_HOST="localhost" fly-live-beats:latest
```

Switch back to the browser and reload the page. It works!

Click the button to sign in.

You may be asked to sign in to GitHub or to approve the application. After a second you should be redirected back to the same URL, `http://localhost:4000`, now signed in:

The Live Beats app is now running, containerized :rocket:

**Note:** If you are using Docker Desktop, in _its_ UI you should also see the container running locally:

![Docker desktop](img/aws_local_docker_running_container.jpeg)

You can stop the container using `Ctrl+C`.

Next I want to [deploy it to Fly.io](/docs/2-fly-io-deploy-it.md)
